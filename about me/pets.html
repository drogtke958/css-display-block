            <h2>My Beloved Pets</h2>
        <p>My lovely cat's name is Dexter, but we all call her Dex. She is very lively and sounds like an elephant running around, especially in the
        morning when we are just waking up she’ll be running around, meowing for food. With her food, she is the pickiest cat I’ve ever met. She, 
        for some reason, doesn’t like fish but loves cheese and raw chicken, and sometimes she won’t eat cooked chicken, which is weird. She was 
        from a barn and we got her as a kitten, she was actually the second cat we got from the place, they told us they were gonna keep her outside 
        where she most likely wouldn’t survive because she was the last of the litter. The first one we had got escaped out of our bathroom window and 
        got hit in the road. After that happened, Dex became a lot more social and didn’t run away from us anymore.

        Our other pet’s name is Lucy, she is an english yellow lab that my parents got when I was 5, so 11 years ago. Lucy is getting old but is 
        still fairly active. She still plays and loves getting pets, but she does struggle getting up and down the stairs though. So sometimes my mom 
        would make my dad carry her up the stairs. Everytime someone is in the kitchen, she is always sitting in her corner waiting for some scrapes, 
        same with our cat, but not as picky. Lucy will eat pretty much everything you give her, except her dog food.</p>
