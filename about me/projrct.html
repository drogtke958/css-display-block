        <h2>My Favorite Project</h2>
    <p>My favorite project in this class was probably the Cupcake Boss project because it was fun to go try a bunch of cupcakes and build our own webpage 
    about it. The cupcakes were all really good and every group was very creative with their themes. For the project part, we got to judge the cupcakes based on 
    certain categories, like taste, creativity, and the group's flyers. After, we got put in groups and created a webpage about the event. We also got to know who won
     each category after the whole event was done. </p>
