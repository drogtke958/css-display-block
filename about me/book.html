            <h2>My Favorite Book</h2>
    <p>The best book I’ve read is one I read very recently, the title was <i>Girl in Pieces</i> by Kathleen Glasgow. This book didn’t actually happen in real life but could happen,
        so I think it’s realistic fiction. The story is about a girl, Charlie, who struggles with mental health issues and was imitated into a mental
        hospital, after spending a lot of time in the hospital her mother comes to get her out. However, instead of taking Charlie home, her mom tells 
        her to go figure out what to do with her life. She ends up going to Arizona where one of her old friends lives now. Her friend, Mikey, is in a
        band and travels around a lot, so Charlie is again left alone. Charlie decides to find work to make some money, she starts being a dishwasher 
        in a restaurant called Grit, she makes enough money to rent her own apartment a few blocks from work. She meets a lot of people and also loses
        a lot of people. I really liked this book because it shows that even people who are struggling still have their place in society, although 
        Charlie never became popular or wealthy she still found a place to be happier than she ever was before.

        Personally I would rate this book a 5 out of 5, it had a lot of emotions in it and was very interesting to read.
       I would highly recommend this book to people who are also struggling with mental health issues and feel there is no getting better or there is no point in getting better.
