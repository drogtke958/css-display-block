            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Keily Drogt, I was born in Traverse City, Michigan and raised in Elk Rapids, Michigan. I am a junior at Elk Rapids High School.
                 I am enrolled in the Web and App Development program at CTC, this wasn’t my original choice but I had to pick a different class that wasn’t full. 
                 After high school I plan to go to college and study psychology.

                I mostly enjoy drawing but I sometimes do coloring as well. At my workplace, I do a lot of cooking and occasionally baking.
                I have worked there for three summers now and have learned a lot. I really enjoyed it, I also met a lot of fun people.
